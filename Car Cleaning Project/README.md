# Predicting Prices of Used Cars using Pandas and R

### Objectives and Performance:

- The purpose of this project was to create a Linear Regression Model that will predict the price of used card based on mileage and age of the vehicle.
- Pandas was used to clean and perform EDA of a 3 million dataset of used cars from the US.
- Hypothesis Tests are performed to determine whether price of used cars are related to other variables such as accidents or fuel-type using R.
- Linear Regression and Prediction is perfomed in R with both mileage and age of different vehicles to predict what the price will be for future cars.

### Results and Improvements:

- The results show a highly accurate predictor model for car prices that can be used by dealerships to establish the best price for a car based on their characteristics.
- Other models can be used as well to classify cars based on their different characteristics and create more accurate models.
- Log transformation can be performed on the price of cars to create a better predictor model with more positive results, since the trend goes as higher mlieage goes, lower the price is.
